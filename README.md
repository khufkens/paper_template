# Generic R paper writing template

[This template](https://github.com/khufkens/paper_writing_template/blob/master/template.Rmd) provides an easy way to setup a journal article structure in the R markdown format which stick to [good paper writing practices](https://khufkens.github.io/paper_writing_checklist/).

In particular the header settings make sure that you will have numbered lines and double spacing. The pages are also numbered. Additional YAML settings make sure that sections are numbered (which can be disabled if desired). Just clone this repository and start writing and render the output as either html, docx or pdf.

This document allows for the rendering of html, docx, and pdf files. An example rendered pdf is [provided in the repository](https://github.com/khufkens/paper_writing_template/raw/master/template.pdf).
